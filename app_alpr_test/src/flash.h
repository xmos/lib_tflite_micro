 * The flash server takes the following commands:
 *   - Read a whole model from the flash.
 *   - Read some parameters from the flash
 *   - (future extension) Read code for an operator from flash
 *
 * This function does, at present, never return. It could be made to return if
 * all clients close their connection
 *
 * \param c_flash_clients Array of channels; one per client.
 *                        Each client is served in turn
 * \param headers         Space to store a header for each client
 *                        The header for the client describes the local
 * "filesystem" for that client \param n_flash_clients Number of clients. The
 * arrays in the first and second parameters should have this many entries
 * \param qspi            Structure holding the quad-flash ports. This contains
 * three Ports and a clock-block, the CS_N port, the CLK port, the DATA port and
 * a clock block to be used for the flash. \param flash_spec      Array holding
 * specificiations of flash devices, as per the libquadflash documentation
 * \param n_flash_spec    Number of elements in the spec array.
